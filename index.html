<h1>The Healthcare Industry’s Ongoing Great Reshuffle</h1>

    <div>
      The declaration of a public health emergency on March 13th 2020 due to the fast-spreading COVID-19 pandemic reverberated across the United States. The economy received a jolt with the Dow Jones Index witnessing one of the largest one-day drops.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div id='container-1' class='container'>

    <div>
      Employment across the US economy was no different. Here we plot the percentage change in the total employment against time.
    </div>

    <div>
      A major employer, the <span class="healthcare">Healthcare</span> industry felt the shock too. Here we add data for the percentage change in healthcare employment to our plot showing percentage change in employment against time.
    </div>

    <div>
      But as COVID-19 progressed, the overall economy and employment in the <span class="healthcare">Healthcare</span> industry recovered.
    </div>

    <div>
      Employment in one part of the healthcare industry, however, has failed to recover since the March 2020 drop. This is the Nursing and Residential Care Facilities industry.

      This line is for <span class="ambulatory">Ambulatory Care</span> which includes doctor's offices, dentists, and optometrists. It still mirrors the general trend seen in the total US labor market.
    </div>

    <div>
      In contrast, <span class="hospital">Hospital</span> employment did not drop as dramatically between March and April 2020, but has decreased overall compared to January 2020.

    <div>
      This is one of the legacies of COVID-19–a “Great Reshuffle” away from low-paid, high-stress work.
    </div>
    <div>
      In fact, for Health Care and Social Assistance, a similar industry tracked by a different Bureau of Labor statistics survey, the ratio of openings over hires is among the highest in the economy–a proxy for employers having trouble filling openings due to rapidly rising demand and falling labor supply
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div id='container-4' class='container'>
  <div class='graph'></div>
  <div class='sections'>
    <div>
      Why is this the case?
    </div>
    <div>
      COVID-19 led to a spike in demands made of healthcare workers: extended hours, uncomfortable protective gear, and a fatal risk of catching the virus
    </div>
    <div>
      While facing these risks, healthcare workers haved earned below-average pay.
    </div>
    <div>
       And as a result droves of healthcare workers continue to leave the industry.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<div id='container-5' class='container'>
  <div class='graph'></div>
  <div class='sections'>
    <div>
      With no sign of the “Great Reshuffle” abating or of labor shortages being mitigated, where does the Healthcare sector go from here?
    </div>
    <div>
      The healthcare industry is counting on a few measures to attract labor: handsome pay and seeking freelance “traveling” nurses.
    </div>
    <div>
      Despite momentary high earnings for some travelling nurses, the future is not bright because this freelance model is unsustainable. 
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div id='container-6' class='container'>
  <div class='graph'></div>
  <div class='sections'>
    <div>
      The Biden administration recently announced a set of reforms to mitigate some of the challenges faced by nurses.
    </div>
    <div>
      These measures home in on nurses’ working conditions, pay scales, training opportunities, and career pathways.
    </div>
    <div>
      The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is currently working on operationalizing these recommendations and on making these actionable. 
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div id='container-7' class='container'>

  <div class='sections'>
    <div>
      With the next pandemic invariably on the horizon, only time will tell if the lessons COVID-19 is offering stakeholders were learnt to produce a more sustainable healthcare workforce–or ignored.
    </div>
    <div>
      And the stakes are high. Not just for healthcare workers themselves but also because they save lives as a natural outcome of their work.
