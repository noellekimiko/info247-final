      On March 13th 2020 a public health emergency was declared by President Trump.

    <div>
      It led to wide-ranging shocks to the overall labor market.
    </div>

    <div>
      The <span class="healthcare">healthcare industry</span> was no exception.
    </div>

    <div>
      But as COVID-19 progressed, the overall economy and the <span class="healthcare">healthcare industry</span> recovered.
    </div>

    <div>
      Disaggregating the <span class="healthcare">healthcare industry</span> tells a slightly different story. This line is for <span class="ambulatory">ambulatory care</span> which includes doctor's offices, dentists, and optometrists. It still mirrors the general trend seen in the total US labor market.
    </div>

    <div>
      In contrast, <span class="hospital">hospital</span> employment did not drop as dramatically between March and April 2020, but has decreased overall compared to January 2020.
    </div>

    <div>
      Another outlier is <span class="nursing">nursing and residential care</span>: employment shows a clear decreasing trend as the pandemic has progressed and has not recoverd.
    </div>

  <div class='sections'>
    <div>
      This is one of the legacies of COVID-19–a “Great Reshuffle” away from low-paid, high-stress work.
    </div>
    <div>
      In fact, for Health Care and Social Assistance, the ratio of openings over hires is among the highest in the economy–a proxy for employers having trouble filling openings due to rapidly rising demand and falling labor supply
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div id='container-4' class='container'>
  <div class='graph'></div>
  <div class='sections'>
    <div>
      Why is this the case?
    </div>
    <div>
      COVID-19 led to a spike in demands made of healthcare workers: extended hours, uncomfortable protective gear, and a fatal risk of catching the virus
    </div>
    <div>
      Studies have captured the risks healthcare workers have faced.
    </div>
    <div>
      While facing these risks, healthcare workers earn below-average pay.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<div id='container-5' class='container'>
  <div class='graph'></div>
  <div class='sections'>
    <div>
      With no signs of abating, where does the Healthcare sector go from here? Healthcare industry will keep growing
    </div>
    <div>
      The future is not bright–pay scales remain low
    </div>
    <div>
      The next pandemic?
